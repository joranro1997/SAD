To correctly use scripts communicating with MongoDB database one should have a MongoDB server running. User needs to add a proper database ("shop"). Connection string in *checkStock.js* might need to be changed, depending on MongoDB server settings. 

Commands:
- npm init
- npm install mongodb
- node .\checkStock.js
